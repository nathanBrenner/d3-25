The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '\u003c' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '\u003c' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.","score":"6.1","score_version":"3.0","score_system":"CVSS","score_details":{"cvssv2":{"vectorString":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","accessVector":"NETWORK","accessComplexity":"MEDIUM","authentication":"NONE","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"PARTIAL","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":4.3},"cvssv3":{"vectorString":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","attackVector":"","attackComplexity":"","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","scope":"CHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","integrityImpact":"LOW","availabilityImpact":"NONE","baseScore":6.1,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM"}},"vector":"","access_complexity":"","vulnerability_authentication":"","confidentiality_impact":"","integrity_impact":"","availability_impact":"","vulnerabilty_source":"","assessment_check":null,"scanner":null,"recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.9.0","dependencies":null,"references":[{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152787/dotCMS-5.1.1-Vulnerable-Dependencies.html","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152787/dotCMS-5.1.1-Vulnerable-Dependencies.html","text":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152787/dotCMS-5.1.1-Vulnerable-Dependencies.html"},{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html","url":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html","text":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153237/RetireJS-CORS-Issue-Script-Execution.html"},{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"20190510 dotCMS v5.1.1 Vulnerabilities","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/10","text":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/10"},{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"20190510 dotCMS v5.1.1 HTML Injection \u0026 XSS Vulnerability","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/11","text":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/11"},{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"20190510 Re: dotCMS v5.1.1 HTML Injection \u0026 XSS Vulnerability","url":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/13","text":"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/13"},{"type":"UNKNOWN","source":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","url":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","text":"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html"}],"modified_at":"2019-06-10T23:29:00Z","published_at":"2018-01-18T23:29:00Z","created_at":"2019-06-11T00:27:56.928556Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T21:50:33.727807Z"},{"id":268039623,"external_id":"CVE-2015-9251","source":[{"id":0,"name":"NVD","description":"National Vulnerability Database","created_at":"2017-02-09T20:18:35.385658Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T20:12:05.342693Z","attribution":"Copyright © 1999–2017, The MITRE Corporation.
